A program to list and classify all of the numbers from 1 to N as specified by user input, along with their non-trivial
factors, the sum of the factors, and the classification of the number. Number classifications are as follows:
- prime if it has no factors other than 1 and itself
- a Unit if it is 1
- Defective if the sum of its factors is less than the number itself
- Perfect if the factor sum is equal to the number
- Super Perfect if the factor sum is greater than the number
